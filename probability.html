  <h1>Probability</h1>
  <h3>Axioms of probability</h3>
  <p>
    A <i>probability measure</i> is a function that assigns a real number
    `P(E)` to each event `E`, for which the following conditions
    (called "axioms") hold:
    <ol>
      <li>For any event `E, P[E] >= 0`</li>
      <li>The measure of the entire space is `P[S] = 1`</li>
      <li>For any two mutually exclusive events `E_1` and `E_2`,
          `E_1 E_2 = O/`, `P[E_1 uu E_2] = P[E_1] + P[E_2]`</li>
    </ol>
  </p>
  <h3>Definitition of statistical independence</h3>
  <p>
    Two events, `A` and `B`, defined on a sample space of a random experiment
    are <i>independent</i> if and only if
      $$ P[A \cap B] = P[A]P[B] $$
    Events `A` and `B` are independent if and only if the probability of their
    intersection is the product `P[A]P[B]`. This means that conditional
    probabilities may be written as
      $$ P[A \, | \, B] = P[A] $$
      $$ P[B \, | \, A] = P[B] $$
  </p>
  <p>
    A random variable is a function that assigns a numerical value to each
    outcome in the sample space of a random experiment.
  </p>
  <p>
    `P[X = x]` is the probability random variable `X` takes on the value x.
    `Pr[X = x], Prob[X = x], bbbP[X = x]` are alternative notations for `P`.
    <br>There are also different notational conventions for events e.g.
    `P(X = x)`, `P[X = x]`, `P{X = x}`, `P({X = x})` are all equivalent.
  </p>
  <p>
    `E[X]` is the expected value of `X` or expectation of `X`.<br>
    `var(X)` is the variance of `X` (expected value of the square of deviations)
      $$ E[(X - E[X])^2]=E[X^2] - (E[X])^2 \tag{1} $$
    `cov(X,Y)` is the covariance of `X` and `Y`
      $$ E[XY] - E[X]E[Y] \tag{2} $$
    The PMF or probability mass function `p_X(x)` is the probability that the
    experimental value of the random variable `X` is equal to `x` on a single
    outcome of the experiment.
      $$ 0 \leq p_X(x) \leq 1 \quad \text{for all $x$} $$
      $$ \sum_{x} p_X(x) = 1 $$
    The PDF or probability density function `f_X(x)` is defined by
      $$ \mathbb{P}[a < X \leq b] = \int_{a}^{b} f_X(x) \, dx $$
    The CDF or cumulative distribution function `F_X(x)` is defined by
      $$ F_X(x) = \mathbb{P}[X \leq x] = \int_{-\infty}^{x} f_X(y) \, dy $$
